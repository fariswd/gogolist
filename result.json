Furthermore, Hotaru is actually a girl who likes to disguise herself as a boy. After hearing rumors that her best friend was tricked by the popular host of a local club, Hotaru seeks to punish the evildoer. Upon arriving at the club, however, she is challenged to a so-called &quot;survival game&quot; by the host Masamune Matsuoka, where the first person hit by the bullet of a toy gun will lose.\r\rAfter a destructive fight which results in Hotaru&#039;s loss, Masamune forces the young &quot;boy&quot; to join his survival game team named Toy Gun Gun, in order to repay the cost of the damages that &quot;he&quot; has caused inside the club. Although she is initially unhappy with this turn of events, Hotaru quickly begins to enjoy what survival games have to offer and is determined to pay off her debt, much to the dismay of Tooru Yukimura, the other member of Toy Gun Gun. As time goes on, Hotaru begins to develop a close friendship with the rest of the team and hopes to take part in realizing their dream of winning the Top Combat Game (TCG), a tournament to decide the best survival game team in Japan.\r\rAlthough Hotaru tries her best, there are just two little problems  she is absolutely terrible at the game, and Toy Gun Gun doesn&#039;t allow female members on their team!"

The only way to escape the dying world is by activating the Ark, an ancient giant robot capable of supporting a human city as well as traveling through space. James Woods plays Jallak, the military leader of the victorious civilization, the Storrians, who is trying to get the Ark to work in order to save his people. Unbeknownst to him, his adopted daughter Amarinth is the direct descendant of the priestess who originally built the Ark, Amiel. The civilization that lost the war, the Ceveans, have since been enslaved. A leader of their resistance movement is a young resistance fighter named Rogan. After discovering the lineage the young woman holds, both civilizations scramble to use Amarinth&#039;s power to activate the Ark and leave the other civilization behind to die. However, Amarinth, who has ties to both civilizations, wishes to try and find a way to use her power to save everyone. She is opposed by the lifeforce-stealing wraith Baramanda, the Empress&#039;s manipulative right-hand man, who wishes to steal the power of the Ark for his own selfish purposes. less"

When a veteran labels his award-winning piece as &quot;unoriginal,&quot; Seishuu quickly loses his cool with severe repercussions.\r\rAs punishment, and also in order to aid him in self-reflection, Seishuu&#039;s father exiles him to the Goto Islands, far from the comfortable Tokyo lifestyle the temperamental artist is used to. Now thrown into a rural setting, Seishuu must attempt to find new inspiration and develop his own unique art style—that is, if boisterous children (headed by the frisky Naru Kotoishi), fujoshi middle schoolers, and energetic old men stop barging into his house! The newest addition to the intimate and quirky Goto community only wants to get some work done, but the islands are far from the peaceful countryside he signed up for. Thanks to his wacky neighbors who are entirely incapable of minding their own business, the arrogant calligrapher learns so much more than he ever hoped to."

He vows to prevent the organization from gaining immortality, and assumes his father’s identity as he begins his quest for the gem. His only clues as to the gem’s location are that it glows red under the full moon and that it is a doublet  a gem hidden within a larger gem. Thus, it would have to be a relatively large one with a bizarre history, and always stored in a place that never receives moonlight. He thus researches and steals famous priceless gems with odd histories from incredibly well-defended areas, and always returns them after the very next full moon."

After becoming young again, the fight begins.\r\rGohan and Piccolo face off against Slug&#039;s three main henchman  Dorodabo, a fat gargoyle, Angira, a Zarbon look-alike, and Medametcha, an extremely strange frog with the ability to create energy-sucking clones of himself. After a little bit of fighting, Goku steps in and kills Medametcha and Angira rather easily. Then it&#039;s Goku vs. Slug in one of the most predictable DBZ movie battles ever. Slug Trashes Goku. Goku goes &quot;Super Saiya-jin&quot; Goku trashes Slug. Slug proves to all that he&#039;s a Namek. Slug grows to super size and trashes Goku. Piccolo joins in and gets hurt. Ho-hum. Then more wierdness enters the story, as Piccolo tells Gohan to whistle--causing Slug to fall to his knees in pain. Goku flies through Slug&#039;s stomach, and then creates a small Genki-dama and defeats the Evil namek. The Earth returns to normal, birds sing, and Master Roshi wakes up from his nap and comments about the beautiful weather."

Denzel, Cloud, and scores of children are suffering from a mysterious new illness called &quot;Geostigma.&quot;\r\rThe children of the city have one other threat looming over their heads—a trio of powerful men are kidnapping infected kids for unknown reasons. Cloud is determined to save these young ones, not only from Geostigma, but from the kidnappers as well.

Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called &quot;automail&quot; and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\r\rThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher&#039;s Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher&#039;s Stone, but their country&#039;s murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity."

The team is going through an abysmal spell right now where they are nearing the bottom of the table and have lost 5 matches in a row. The loses haven’t done much to team moral, because it was already low. Fan support, on the other hand, is looking bleak. In the world of football, once the fans turn on a team the end is near.\r\rTeams don’t recover. Coaches are fired, players are sold, and teams drop to smaller divisions where profits often prevent them from ever being successful against even mediocre top division programs. East Tokyo United, ETU, can only blame their coach right now. And Coach is ready to give up this next game to prove to his team and fans, that against the biggest club in the nation he can make this team win."

Different nations have united together to form three major factions—the Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations, the Advanced European Union, and the Human Reform League. Each of these sectors has access to a solar power generator, which gives them limitless energy.\r\rAs a result, countries that were once dependent on the sale of fossil fuels are now plunged in poverty, leading to years of warfare and internal strife over the control of solar energy.

Their new high school is no ordinary academic institution. Rather than concentrating on classic subjects like math and science, Toudou Academy was created for the sole purpose of reviving the martial arts in Japan!\r\rAs a result, Souichiro&#039;s aspirations to become top dog are cut short when he runs afoul of Masataka Takayanagi and Maya Natsume. The two upperclassmen easily stop the freshmen duo&#039;s rampage across school, but rather than serving as a deterrent, it only stokes their competitive fire. What kind of monstrous fighters attend Toudou Academy? Are there any stronger than Masataka and Maya? And why in the world is Maya&#039;s younger sister stalking Souichiro? Learn the answers to these questions and more in Tenjou Tenge!"

Meanwhile, second-year student Ena Komiya seeks to revive the photography club to its former glory, refusing to let the organization be disbanded. Though this group lacks a strong connection with one another, their lives suddenly cross paths with the arrival of a third-year transfer student.\r\rWhile a transfer so close to graduation is unusual for most, it is business as usual for Eita Izumi. Due to his father&#039;s work, he has never been able to stay in one place for very long. But as luck would have it, their most recent relocation has returned Eita to his hometown for his final semester of high school. For better or worse, it also sparks the rekindling of old relationships left behind in the past.\r\rWith graduation already causing its own share of anxieties, Eita&#039;s sudden arrival brings these students&#039; carefree days to an abrupt end. Long-forgotten memories, deeply buried emotions, and inspiring new passions—everything is brought to light in their bittersweet final semester."

But Kazuma has made a grave mistake—Aqua is completely useless!\r\rUnfortunately, their troubles don&#039;t end here; it turns out that living in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a game. Instead of going on a thrilling adventure, the duo must first work to pay for their living expenses. Indeed, their misfortunes have only just begun!"

And Kanako, Kisaki’s most romantically unfortunate student, STILL doesn’t accept them either. They give her the hives. Literally.

Poor Kanako! She came to school to major in loving women, and instead she’s STILL failing relationships in Maria Holic Alive!"

Facing an enormous mass of enemy force, mankind has developed large humanoid arms called as Tactical Surface Fighters and deployed them to its defense lines through out the world. However, all those efforts could slow down defeats but could not stop BETA, and mankind is forced to abandon major area of the Eurasian Continent.\r\rFor 30 years, mankind is bogged down in an endless war against BETA without any hopes of victory. In 2001, the Imperial Japan faces difficulties in the development of a next-generation main Tactical Surface Fighters (TSF) as it defends the front lines of the Far East. The UN has proposed a joint development program between the Imperial Japan and the United States as a part of its international mutual development project of TSF, the Prominence Project. Yui Takamura, a surface pilot of the Imperial Royal Guards of Japan, is given responsibility for the project and sets off to Alaska. Meanwhile, Yuya Bridges, also a surface pilot of the US Army, was heading to the same destination. Yet they never knew that their encounter would change their destiny drastically. This story with exciting human dramas and robot actions takes place in the development of a new Tactical Surface Fighters, the most important and effective weapons against BETA, at a crisis of human extinction."

Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.\r\rThis all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama&#039;s disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he&#039;ll become popular in the process."

The place  Edo, now known as Tokyo.\r\rOne of the highest populated cities in the world, teeming with peasants, samurai, townsmen, merchants, nobles, artists, courtesans, and perhaps even supernatural things.\r\rA much accomplished artist of his time and now in his mid-fifties, Tetsuzo can boast clients from all over Japan, and tirelessly works in the garbage-loaded chaos of his house-atelier. He spends his days creating astounding pieces of art, from a giant-size Bodhidharma portrayed on a 180 square meter-wide sheet of paper, to a pair of sparrows painted on a tiny rice grain. Short-tempered, utterly sarcastic, with no passion for sake or money, he would charge a fortune for any job he is not really interested in.\r\rThird of Tetsuzo&#039;s four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father&#039;s talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. &quot;We&#039;re father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.&quot;\r\rDecades later, Europe was going to discover the immense talent of Tetsuzo. He was to become best known by one of his many names  Katsushika Hokusai. He would mesmerize Renoir and van Gogh, Monet and Klimt.\r\rHowever, very few today are even aware of the woman who assisted him all his life, and greatly contributed to his art while remaining uncredited. This is the untold story of O-Ei, Master Hokusai&#039;s daughter  a lively portrayal of a free-spirited woman overshadowed by her larger-than-life father, unfolding through the changing seasons."

The Simoun can activate a magical power known as “Ri Maajon” that can destroy large numbers of enemies at once.\r\rWhen the industrialized nation of Argentum decides that it needs to invade Simulacrum to acquire the secret of the Simoun, war breaks out, drawing the Simoun “Sibyllae” (priestesses who fly the Simoun) into a lopsided battle. Because the war is raging, the Sibyllae are granted an exemption from choosing a permanent sex for as long as they’re willing to keep flying. Aaeru, a determined young Sibylla with a mysterious past, and Neviril, the leader of Chor Tempest, Simulacrum’s most elite Simoun squadron, must lead their fellow priestesses through conflict both within their ranks and in the sky."

However, in accordance with the theory of relativity, this corresponds to only two subjective years (time as experienced by those within the spacecraft).\r\rThe two of them had lost their parents when they were young and the bond between the two is very close. It is Sara’s dearest wish to be reunited with her brother. To do that, she must travel to the battlefield where he is.\r\rOne day, Sara’s planet is suddenly assaulted by Deague forces. To her surprise, her brother, Ralph, turns out to be one of the raiders who successfully kidnap a mysterious girl sleeping in a capsule.\r\rIn order to find the truth, Sara gets in a Strain and chases after him. However, she is attacked by Ralph, and the Mimic, a copy of the pilot’s brain which is essential to controlling the Strain, is damaged."

The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong.\r\rAnother significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu’s Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei’s Viper Blade.

In the summer of 1996, three 9th-graders had made a promise that one day they&#039;ll build an aircraft and unravel the tower&#039;s mystery, but their project was abandoned after the girl, Sayuri Sawatari, began experiencing sleeping sickness and transferred to Tokyo for better treatment. Three years later, Hiroki Fujisawa accidentally found out that Sayuri had been in a coma since then, and he asked Takuya Shirakawa to help him finding a way to revive her. What they don&#039;t know yet is that Sayuri&#039;s unconsciousness is somehow linked with secrets of the tower and the world."

As the night class is full of utterly gorgeous elites, this can sometimes prove to be a bit difficult. It is completely necessary, however, as those &quot;elites&quot; are actually vampires. Yuuki and Zero act as guardians, protecting the secrets of the Night Class and the safety of the ignorant day class.\r\rAs the adopted daughter of the academy&#039;s chairman, Yuuki takes her job with a serious and energetic attitude. It also allows her to interact with her secret crush and savior, the night class&#039; dorm president, Kaname Kuran. Zero, on the other hand, has a deep-rooted hatred against vampires, and at times, does not hesitate to kill.\r\rCan vampires and humans co-exist, even in the strict setup of the Cross Academy?

The U.S. version would rename the &quot;Galbeston Empire&quot; to &quot;Drule Empire,&quot; along with editing a fair amount of violence and sexual content to keep the show safe for general audience broadcast."

Everyone deems this to be yet another failure, but when the smoke clears, a boy named Saito Hiraga appears. Now Louise&#039;s familiar, Saito is treated as a slave, forced to clean her clothes and eat off the ground. But when an unfamiliar brand is found etched on Saito&#039;s hand from the summoning ritual, it is believed to be the mark of a powerful familiar named Gandalfr.\r\rWild, adventurous, and explosive, Zero no Tsukaima follows Saito as he comes to terms with his new life and as Louise proves that there is more to her than her nickname suggests."
